# Decisions

This doc includes a list of decisions we made for Sponty and why we made them.

1. Not deploying Sponty on GCP
    * GCP's single container run offering costs about £30 a month for always on containers (which Sponty needs to be) - too expensive
2. Using AWS Lightsail Containers for running Sponty
    * AWS' single container run offering costs about £4 a month for always on containers. Having Sponty run in a public cloud allows us to build it using CI/CD.
    * Cannot be managed via TF but we can push directly to it and it will automatically create a new deployment
